# Example 1
#
# This example gets the latest tag scanned and it's associated time from the
# Qwiic RFID Reader when the user enters "1" into the terminal. The
# "scan" time is not the time of the day the RFID card was scanned but rather the
# time between when the card was scanned and when you the user requested the RFID
# tag from the Qwiic RFID Reader.
