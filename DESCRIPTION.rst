Qwiic RFID 
==========================

This is a python package for SparkFun's Qwiic RFID Reader (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15191). 
The functions included can get RFID tag ID's and their scan times. It's also possible to change the 
I2C address of the reader to something other than the default so that multiple can be daisy-chained 
on the same bus.
